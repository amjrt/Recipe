    <p> <b>Homemade Hot Chocolate: You sweet, creamy heavenly thing. 
    If you were wondering how I would like to <br> spend every 
    December evening, it is curled up, with my hands wrapped 
    around a warm mug of hot chocolate. <br> Bonus points if that 
    hot chocolate is topped with freshly whipped cream and a 
    heavy sprinkle of chopped dark chocolate. </b></p> 
    <p> <b>
    Filed under the list of things I will not consume: frosting 
    from a tub, cool whip, and hot <br> chocolate out of a packet. 
    Friends, it is so incredibly easy to make Homemade Hot 
    Chocolate. Put down that powdery <br> packet! Throw a handful 
    of real ingredients into a saucepan and you will have
    Homemade Hot Chocolate in minutes! <br> </b> </p> <p> <b>
    It's simple, delicious, and so much more satisfying 
    than the store-bought stuff. 
    This recipe is made with a combination of cocoa<br> powder and 
    chocolate chips. The cocoa powder adds the distinct “hot 
    cocoa” flavor, and the chocolate chips melt into the mixture 
    making this <br>drink extra creamy, rich and luxurious. A 
    splash of vanilla extract rounds out all that chocolaty 
    flavor and makes this what <br>I consider the perfect Homemade 
    Hot Chocolate. </b></p>
